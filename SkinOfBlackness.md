# A Skin of Blackness

## Introduction

The Book of Mormon, in Mormon’s words, “is an abridgment of the record of the people of Nephi, and also of the Lamanites”. In this account, the Nephites are described as the (usually) more righteous group while the Lamanites “\[delight\] in wars and bloodshed” (Jacob 7:24). These two distinguished groups vie for centuries before the Nephites too become wicked and are then overcome by their adversaries.

In this article, I'll discuss a distinguishing characteristic of the Lamanites—their dark skin. This characteristic is interpreted as either a curse of literally dark skin by some readers of the Book of Mormon and a racist interpolation made by either Nephite writers of The Book of Mormon or Joseph Smith himself by others. I hope this article can inform us on the issue and offer some clarification from what the book itself has to say on the matter.

Let's start at the beginning of the Book of Mormon. Soon after Lehi's family departs from Jerusalem into the wilderness, Nephi seems to wrestle with the veracity of his father's revelations from the Lord through which Lehi was instructed to take his family and leave Jerusalem being warned that it would be destroyed. Nephi states, "I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did visit me, and did soften my heart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by my father; wherefore, I did not rebel against him like unto my brothers." (1 Nephi 2:16). After this heart-changing experience, Nephi attempts to share his conviction with his older brothers who have mixed reactions. While Sam is persuaded by Nephi, "Laman and Lemuel would not hearken unto \[Nephi's\] words" (1 Nephi 2:18).

Laman and Lemuel's resistance to Nephi's words is the precedent for what would become a millennial-long feud consisting of continual wars and hatred between the peoples who will come to be known as Nephites and Lamanites. But to this initial resistance of Laman and Lemuel, Nephi reacts by "\[crying\] unto the Lord for them" (1 Nephi 2:18) to which the Lord responds by saying to Nephi:

## 1 Nephi 2:19-24

> Blessed art thou, Nephi, because of thy faith, for thou hast sought me diligently, with lowliness of heart. And inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper, and shall be led to a land of promise; yea, even a land which I have prepared for you; yea, a land which is choice above all other lands. And inasmuch as thy brethren shall rebel against thee, they shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord. And inasmuch as thou shalt keep my commandments, thou shalt be made a ruler and a teacher over thy brethren. For behold, in that day that they shall rebel against me, I will **curse** them even with a sore **curse**, and they shall have no power over thy seed except they shall rebel against me also. And if it so be that they rebel against me, they shall be a scourge unto thy seed, to stir them up in the ways of remembrance.

Note the mentioning of a curse upon Laman and Lemuel. Although it's not stated here exactly what the curse is, the Lord juxtaposes its mentioning with a statement that Laman and Lemuel will "have no power over \[Nephi's\] seed" unless they rebel against Him too. One might infer three things from this:

1. The curse is contingent upon Laman and Lemuel's rebellion toward the Lord.
1. The curse will affect Laman and Lemuel's seed.
1. The curse will result in Nephi's seed being protected, as long as they don't rebel.

The next mentioning of a curse is in Nephi's rebuking words to his brothers which ensues after they complain against Nephi's aspiration to build a ship and his claim that God had so instructed him. Nephi responds to them by bringing up Moses and the "great work" that he was commanded of God to do (1 Nephi 17:26). He describes how the Israelites' exodus from Egypt and spree of conquering and acquiring Caananite lands was due to God's favoring of the Israelites' righteousness and the Caananites' wickedness.

## 1 Nephi 17:35, 37-38

> Behold, **the Lord esteemeth all flesh in one; he that is righteous is favored of God**. But behold, this people had rejected every word of God, and they were ripe in iniquity; and the fulness of the wrath of God was upon them; and the Lord did **curse** the land against them, and bless it unto our fathers; yea, he did **curse** it against them unto their destruction, and he did bless it unto our fathers unto their obtaining power over it... And he raiseth up a righteous nation, and destroyeth the nations of the wicked. And he leadeth away the righteous into precious lands, and the wicked he destroyeth, and **curseth** the land unto them for their sakes.

While Nephi teaches of God's cursing upon the wicked, he teaches a concept that is important for us to keep in mind while considering this topic: "The Lord esteemeth all flesh in one; he that is righteous is favored of God"; i.e., God is no respector of persons (Romans 2:11), but discriminates only upon the characteristic of righteousness. This is a comforting doctrine in an era where there's much sensitivity over unfair discrimination based on race, gender, etc.

Lehi, after his family's arrival in the promised land of America, teaches Nephi's brethren echoing these ideas Nephi taught: "...for if iniquity shall abound cursed shall be the land for their sakes, but unto the righteous it shall be blessed forever." (2 Nephi 1:7). He continues in exorting Nephi's brothers: "Awake! and arise from the dust, and hear the words of a trembling parent" (1 Nephi 1:14). And this to avoid a consequence Lehi dreads for his sons.

## 2 Nephi 1:17-19

> My heart hath been weighed down with sorrow from time to time, for I have feared, lest for the hardness of your hearts the Lord your God should come out in the fulness of his wrath upon you, that ye be cut off and destroyed forever; Or, that a **cursing** should come upon you for the space of many generations; and ye are visited by sword, and by famine, and are **hated**, and are led according to the will and captivity of the devil. O my sons, that these things might not come upon you, but that ye might be a choice and a favored people of the Lord.

This "sore cursing" (2 Nephi 1:22) that Lehi refers to is mentioned once more by Lehi in his final blessings and words to his Laman's sons and daughters.

## 2 Nephi 4:5-7

> But behold, my sons and my daughters, I cannot go down to my grave save I should leave a blessing upon you; for behold, I know that if ye are brought up in the way ye should go ye will not depart from it. Wherefore, if ye are cursed, behold, I leave my blessing upon you, that the cursing may be taken from you and be answered upon the heads of your parents. Wherefore, because of my blessing the Lord God will not suffer that ye shall perish; wherefore, he will be merciful unto you and unto your seed forever.

Lehi then offers the same blessing to the children of Lemuel—words that are curious to one who is familiar with the story and knows that these children would indeed "depart from" the instructed way Lehi had taught; even this first generation initiated wars and bloodshed upon the people of Nephi and continued in rebelling against and hating Nephi's people. Additionally, it doesn't appear that the curse of God is "taken from \[them\] and answerd upon the heads of \[their\] parents." Nephi and his record-authoring successors repeatedly refer to the curse being active and present among the Lamanites (ref needed). How can these two statements be reconciled with the record of the Book of Mormon history?

It may be that Lehi's blessing would be fulfilled over a long span of time. Lehi's blessing that the Lamanites would not perish indeed did prove true—though it took a thousand years—they eventually overpowered the Nephites and the remants of the Lamanites survived to the restoration and coming forth of the Book of Mormon (1 Nephi 12:19). And what of Lehi's blessing that the curse would be taken from Laman and Lemuel's children? In 3 Nephi we read of a time when the righteous Lamanites and Nephites join together in union against the Gadianton robbers and it is said that the Lamanites' "curse was taken from them, and their skin became white like unto the Nephites" (3 Nephi 2:15). And this is not the only instance where Nephites and Lamanites mix.

After Lehi's death, Laman and Lemuel's feud with Nephi culminated. Nephi said, “the Lord did warn me, that I, Nephi, should depart from them and flee into the wilderness, and all those who would go with me” (2 Nephi 5:5). It's soon after this point in the record that Nephi revisits that initial revelation he had gotten from the Lord. Here's that again for reference:

## 1 Nephi 2:19-24 (again)

> Blessed art thou, Nephi, because of thy faith, for thou hast sought me diligently, with lowliness of heart. And inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper, and shall be led to a land of promise; yea, even a land which I have prepared for you; yea, a land which is choice above all other lands. And inasmuch as thy brethren shall rebel against thee, they shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord. And inasmuch as thou shalt keep my commandments, **thou shalt be made a ruler and a teacher over thy brethren**. For behold, in that day that they shall rebel against me, **I will curse them even with a sore curse**, and they shall have no power over thy seed except they shall rebel against me also. And if it so be that they rebel against me, they shall be a scourge unto thy seed, to stir them up in the ways of remembrance.

Nephi specifically notes the fulfillment of the words of the Lord spoken to him as he recounts many years after they were given:

## Nephi being a ruler and teacher over his brethren

### 2 Nephi 5:19

> And behold, **the words of the Lord had been fulfilled** unto my brethren, which he spake concerning them, that I should be their ruler and their teacher. Wherefore, I had been their ruler and their teacher, according to the commandments of the Lord, until the time they sought to take away my life.

## Lamanites being cut off from the presence of the Lord

### 2 Nephi 5:20

> Wherefore, the word of the Lord was fulfilled which he spake unto me, saying that: Inasmuch as they will not hearken unto thy words they shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord. And behold, they were cut off from his presence.

It's apparent that Nephi remembers these prophecies and finds it important to write of the fulfilment of them, much in line with other Jewish writers (see Matthew 2:5).

Nephi then expounds on the fulfilment of the second prophecy including discussing the curse God mentioned. This is a long excerpt but I've got to include it all because this is perhaps the most elaborate description of the curse.

## Nephi's description of the curse

### 2 Nephi 5:21-25

<blockquote>
And he had caused the <b>cursing</b> to come upon them, yea, even <b>a sore cursing</b>, because of their iniquity. For behold, they had hardened their hearts against him, that they had become like unto a flint; wherefore, as they were white, and exceedingly fair and delightsome, that they might not be enticing unto my people the Lord God did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them.

And thus saith the Lord God: I will cause that they shall be loathsome unto thy people, save they shall repent of their iniquities.

And <b>cursed</b> shall be the seed of him that mixeth with their seed; for they shall be <b>cursed</b> even with the same cursing. And the Lord spake it, and it was done.

And because of their <b>cursing</b> which was upon them they did become an idle people, full of mischief and subtlety, and did seek in the wilderness for beasts of prey.

And the Lord God said unto me: They shall be a scourge unto thy seed, to stir them up in remembrance of me; and inasmuch as they will not remember me, and hearken unto my words, they shall scourge them even unto destruction.
</blockquote>

> <h3><i>Aside</i></h3> Before moving on, as an aside, I want to point out how this supports the internal claim of The Book of Mormon, that it is an authentic record and not a fabrication of Joseph Smith's imagining, by Nephi explicitly referring to His initial prophecy given many years (and many pages) earlier by using exact wording in certain phrases, such as the use of the phrase "a sore cursing".
</br>

As I attempt to explicate some details from these verses, let me use this opportunity to offer a caveat, I admit that this article entails my own interpretation of scripture and while I'm attempting to be as objective as possible and use what I consider to be a common-sense interpretation, I could always be blind to important details or insights. But I'll do my best to offer interpretations that appeal to a rational and objective perspective.

### A breakdown of 2 Nephi 5:21-25

#### Flint

> ...they had hardened their hearts against him, that they had become like unto a flint;

While proponents of the literal-skin-of-blackness theory might suggest that this verse compares the Lamanites cursed skin color to the dark color of a flint stone, it isn't entirely clear whether Nephi is comparing Laman and Lemuel's hearts or skin color to flint. In fact, the only other references to "flint" in The Book of Mormon are made by Isaiah and appear to refer to the hard, stony aspect of flint; "Therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed." (2 Nephi 7:7; Isaiah 50:7). In other words, Isaiah would set his face firm and fixed, like a stone. This is the prevailing interpretation of Isaiah's use of flint here ([What does it mean to set your face like flint in Isaiah 50:7?](https://www.gotquestions.org/face-like-flint.html)).

In light of Isaiah's usage of "flint" and Nephi's familiarity with such, as well as the placement of the flint reference being after a statement about the hardness of hearts, it's most likely that Nephi was comparing Laman and Lemuel's hearts to the hardness of flint rather than comparing the color of their skin to the color of flint, which can be a blackish/grayish color.

In fact, the comma separating the two clauses might be removed to clarify this interpretation (remember that punctuation was not present in the original transcripts of The Book of Mormon):

> ...they had hardened their hearts against him that they had become like unto a flint;

#### White, and exceedingly fair and delightsome

Nephi contrasts the Lamanites as once being "white, and exceedingly fair and delightsome" but now having "a skin of blackness to come upon them."

> ...wherefore, as they were **white, and exceedingly fair and delightsome**, that they might not be enticing unto my people the Lord God did cause a **skin of blackness** to come upon them.

"White" and "blackness" are descriptive words typically used to describe physical appearance. Sometimes white and black can be used to denote light or darkness—terms that are often used figuratively as in "secret works of **darkness**" (2 Nephi 9:9) and "having had so much **light** and so much knowledge given unto them of the Lord their God" (Alma 9:19). 

But in The Book of Mormon, "black" and "blackness" are only used 3 other times and none of them are figurative. "White", however, is used many times, 34 to be precise, such as in describing the "white robe" of an angel (1 Nephi 8:5), the fruit of the tree of life (1 Nephi 8:11), garments purified by Christ's blood (1 Nephi 12:10), the skin color of those towards whom God shows no favoritivism (2 Nephi 26:33), the color of a hair (3 Nephi 12:36), and the color of the stones the brother of Jared gathered before bringing them to the Lord (Ether 3:1).

Of the 34 occurences of the term, 22 describe literally white objects, such as the instances named above, whereas the remainder describe what could be white skin or a figurative brightness indicating purity or glory of individuals, depending on how you interpret the verses.

While purity and brightness are fine interpretations of the word "white", is that what The Book of Mormon writers meant when they used the term? Was that what Joseph Smith meant to convey in the translation? Or are those opting for this interpretation arriving at it not by a rational reading of the text but out of a desire to soothe a desire to avoid an uncomfortable idea?

In the rest of the article, you'll discover that The Book of Mormon offers many verses that *shed light* on the matter.

Before moving on to the rest of Nephi's statement in question, I do want to address the raised hands of many readers wanting to point out that Joseph Smith changed "white" to "pure" in the 1840 edition of The Book of Mormon. This is indeed true. In the 1830 edition of The Book of Mormon 2 Nephi 30:6 reads "...they shall be a white and a delightsome people." while in the 1840 edition Joseph changed it to "...they shall be a pure and a delightsome people."

"Pure" alone doesn't denote a color at all, but rather being clean. In the Bible, the word is often translated from טָהוֹר (ṭâôr) which means pure, clean (ceremonially, morally, or physically). What does this change mean as we attempt to understand the meaning of this verse?

The context of this verse is that Nephi is prophecying how a remnant of his seed will have the gospel of Jesus Christ declared unto them and be given a knowledge of their ancestors, the Nephites, via The Book of Mormon. "And then shall they rejoice; for they shall know that it is a blessing unto them from the hand of God; and their **scales of darkness** shall begin to fall from their eyes; and many generations shall not pass away among them, save they shall be a **pure and delightsome people**." (2 Nephi 30:6)

"Scales" here being a conspicuous reference to Acts 9:18, "And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized". It seems these scales symbolized spiritual blindness. If we apply this to 2 Nephi 30:6 we get a figurative idea of the remnant of Nephi, presumedly among the native americans, awakening from a spiritual blindness to a knowledge of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

While some may have interpreted that these conversions would entail a change of skin color by the 1830 version's "white" descriptor, that no longer seems to be the intended meaning when replaced with "pure". It seems that Nephi is prophecying that they will become purified and spiritual awakened rather than experience a change of skin color.

But does the change of "white" to "pure" in this verse give us license to reinterpret every instance of "white" as a figurative purity? Certainly not. In fact, this wouldn't even make sense in many cases where "white" is obviously referring to the literal color. But it does open the possibility that perhaps some of these instances may be subject to a figurative interpretation.

#### Skin of blackness

Moving on to the next phrase in Nephi's description we get this:

> ...that they might not be enticing unto my people the Lord God did cause a **skin of blackness** to come upon them.

Nephi describes a skin of blackness that came upon the Lamanites. Literally, this would mean that the Lamanites' skin became black or dark in color. To try and work in a figurative interpretation of "skin of blackness" here is difficult, especially considering that Nephi mentions this characteristic as making the Lamanites unenticing to his people.

I've heard it posed that this was a sort of figurative, spiritual darkness but if so, why did Nephi say "skin" and wouldn't there have been a less confusing way to describe such a spiritual state such as being "spiritually dead" or "walking in darkness" (both scriptural terms used to describe such a state). There's no precedent in scripture that suggests such a phrase would be figurative.

By the rule of Occam's razor, I must conclude that the literal interpretation of this verse makes much more sense.

#### The Lamanites; a loathsome people

> And thus saith the Lord God: I will cause that they shall be loathsome unto thy people, save they shall repent of their iniquities.

For those unfamiliar with the term, loathsome means "disgusting, hateful, detestable".

The curse of God upon the Lamanites for their rebellion against Him included that they became "dark, filthy, and loathsome" and this state was not only the state of the Lamanites, but also of the Nephites when they began to rebel against the Lord (Mormon 5:15).

This adjective triplet of "dark, filthy, and loathsome" used by Mormon contrastes nicely with "white, fair, and delightsome" leaving me wondering whether Mormon posed it as a deliberately opposing description of Nephi's oft-used description shown in the latter.

#### Cursed shall be the seed that mixeth

Nephi now quotes words spoken and fulfilled by the Lord about the mixing of seeds between the cursed and the blessed.

> ...cursed shall be the seed of him that mixeth with their seed; for they shall be cursed even with the same cursing. And the Lord spake it, and it was done.

This is a curious characteristic of the curse as it might suggest a genetic facet to the curse. If the curse carried some genetic weight, this fits well with the literal interpretation of dark skin but makes less sense with a figurative view of darkness.

However, it should be noted that the curse is described as more than "blackness of skin". Remember the loathsomeness mentioned as part of the curse? That aspect doesn't make as much sense from a genetic standpoint. Regardless, the genetic passing of at least part of the curse may occur and it's not by mere association with the Lamanites, but in reproduction with them, or the mixing of seeds.

#### An idle people

> ...because of their cursing which was upon them they did become an idle people, full of mischief and subtlety, and did seek in the wilderness for beasts of prey.

This verse doesn't indicate anything about the skin of blackness as far as I can tell.

#### A scourge unto thy people

> ...They shall be a scourge unto thy seed, to stir them up in remembrance of me; and inasmuch as they will not remember me, and hearken unto my words, they shall scourge them even unto destruction.

As with many cases, God accomplishes more than one objective at a time—while cursing the Lamanites, He provides a reminder for the Nephites to always remember Him and hearken unto Him, otherwise they would experience the violent attacks of the Lamanites, which did in fact end up happening many times.

<hr>

Alright, we've gotten through Nephi's primary description of the curse. Now we have the rest of The Book of Mormon to use to help us interpret it, particularly the debatable ideas such as was the skin of blackness a curse, a mark of the curse, and was it literal or figurative? I think that with the aid of these additional verses we'll be able to come to a rational conclusion.

## Other Book of Mormon verses about the curse

### A description of Mary

In Nephi's vision he sees Mary, the mother of Jesus.

#### 1 Nephi 11:13

> ...And I beheld the city of Nazareth; and in the city of Nazareth I beheld a virgin, and she was exceedingly **fair and white**.

Is Nephi stating that Mary was fair and had white skin? Two verses later he describes her again calling her "most beautiful and fair". Since Nephi seems occupied with Mary's physical appearance and beauty it would follow that his descriptors "white" would most likely apply to Mary's appearance. Whether this is to say that her skin was white or that she was white in a glorious, light-emanating sense is less definite. Although, as we'll find later, the Nephite authors of The Book of Mormon often group physical beauty descriptors with "white", perhaps suggesting that in their cultural taste, "white" may have been a trait deemed beautiful.

### White Europeans

#### 1 Nephi 13:15

> ...and I beheld that they were **white, and exceedingly fair and beautiful**, like unto my people before they were slain

Here, Nephi refers to the Gentiles, who are the Europeans who voyaged to the Americas in the transatlantic migration. Europeans do have white skin, just as the Nephites are described to have had before they were slain. A figurative interpretation of "white" here doesn't easily fit.

### Nephi's description

#### 2 Nephi 5:21

> ...wherefore, as they were **white, and exceedingly fair and delightsome**, that they might not be enticing unto my people the Lord God did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them.

I know we've already discussed this to some degree, but it should be noted here that the skin of blackness must have been a visible trait such that it would make the Lamanites unenticing to the Nephites. The language here again seems to indicate that the Nephites may have had a cultural perception that white skin was enticing and dark skin was unenticing.

### All are alike unto God

#### 2 Nephi 26:33

> For none of these iniquities come of the Lord; for he doeth that which is good among the children of men; and he doeth nothing save it be plain unto the children of men; and he inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come unto him, **black and white**, bond and free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God, both Jew and Gentile.

I reference this example because it apparently refers to those with black skin and those with white skin, both being alike unto God. This is a powerful verse describing God's unbiased and unprejudiced love. But, for those who argue a figurative interpretation of dark skins, I have point the inconsistency of those who interpret "black and white" as describing literal skin color here but having a figurative interpretation elsewhere. If we're being consistent, I find no precedent to interpret the other instances of "black" or "dark" skin as being figurative if we are to interpret this instance as being literal.

### Jacob's sermon and Nephite perception of purity

#### Jacob 3:5, 8

> ...the Lamanites your brethren, whom ye hate because of their filthiness and the cursing which hath come upon their skins, are more righteous than you... I fear that unless ye shall repent of your sins that their skins will be whiter than yours, when ye shall be brought with them before the throne of God.

Book of Mormon prophet, Jacob, condemns the Nephites for their wicked practices in this sermon noting that the Lamanites were, at that time, more righteous. Jacob cautions that the Lamanite's skins may be whiter than the Nephites' at judgement day if they do not repent.

If Jacob is refering to the pigment color of the skin then this reflects an interesting belief of Jacob's—that one's whiteness of skin color at judgement day will indicate their righteousness. Or could Jacob be referring to a figurative white skin at judgement day? Could this language refer to garments that can be washed white by the blood of Christ (Alma 5:21)?

It is a bit of a stretch to claim that Jacob is referring to garments or clothing becoming white rather than literal skin color, but it is possible to arrive at that interpretation. In Genesis we see that the clothing that the Lord made for Adam and Eve is refered to as "coats of skins" (Genesis 3:21).

### The mark, which *is* a curse

#### Alma 3:6

> And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them because of their transgression and their rebellion against their brethren, who consisted of Nephi, Jacob, and Joseph, and Sam, who were just and holy men.

This verse is followed be several more verses that elaborate on the curse and how God causes a visible distinguishing mark to be set on those who rebel against Him. Mormon notes how the Amlicites mark themselves with "a mark of red upon their foreheads" (Alma 3:13) which serves the same purpose of the mark of dark skin that God had set upon the Lamanites.

While the mark of dark skin is described here as "a curse upon them" and not merely "the mark of a curse", as I've often heard it taught, it could be the case that various visible markers could have been used in addition to, or instead of, dark skin. The purpose of the mark was funamentally to distinguish those who had rebelled against God from those who followed Him.

There may be no clearer passage in The Book of Mormon to support the literal-skin-color interpretation than this. Mormon here clearly describes that the Lamanite's cursed mark was dark skin, a visible characteristic, not figurative. In conjunction with the Amlicites' red mark on their foreheads, this only makes sense as a description of literally dark skin.

I can't see any sane interpretation of this passage that supports any figurative interpretation of the dark skins described.

### The curse lifted from the Lamanites

#### 3 Nephi 2:15

> And their curse was taken from them, and their skin became white like unto the Nephites;

At this point, righteous Lamanites mix among the Nephites and their curse is said to be taken from them. This change probably occurs among the seed of the mixed Lamanite/Nephite marriages—"And their **young men** and their **daughters** became exceedingly fair, and they were numbered among the Nephites, and were called Nephites." (3 Nephi 2:16)

Here, again, we see that such physical traits are coupled with "exceedingly fair", seeming to indicate that "their skin \[becoming\] white" is perceived as an attractive trait among the Nephites.

### Moroni's plea to unbelievers

#### Mormon 9:6

> ...cry mightily unto the Father in the name of Jesus, that perhaps ye may be found spotless, **pure, fair, and white**, having been cleansed by the blood of the Lamb, at that great and last day.

Mormon's son, Moroni, concludes his deceased father's record by addressing the unbelieving readers of The Book of Mormon, urging them to "cry mightily" in hopes that they "may be found spotless, pure, fair, and white". It wouldn't make much sense for Moroni to suggest that if one prays to God they can become beautiful and attractive, leaving us with the more compelling alternative that these descriptors indicate purity and holiness. Moroni's usage of "white" may be referring to white garments as in Ether 13:10, "...garments are white through the blood of the Lamb". Or it may be describing brightness and glory.

## Final thoughts

After this extensive review of descriptions of the Lamanite curse, I conclud that the most rational interpretation is that this was a literal dark skin. With Nephi's description—"skin of blackness" (2 Nephi 5:21), Mormon's description—"the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers" (Alma 3:6), and the many others mentioned in this article, I am forced to admit that not only is this the most compelling stance, but the figurative interpretation is a rationally untenable position, one which requires inconsistent logic and excrutiating mental gymnastics.

While I have seen many notable members of the Church who are known for their gospel insights take the figurative-interpretation stance, I must uncomfortably conclude that they are either ignorant of the scriptures that clarify this topic or have taken an illogical stance to placate their personal or political interests.

Now, what are the implications of this interpretation? That might take another article to discuss (or several). But I find it important to point out that this curse and mark of dark skin set upon the Lamanites does not imply that dark skin is universally a curse from God, only that it was the specific mark that God used for His purposes among the Nephites. Perhaps it could have been blue skin or purple hair—the mark was meant to distinguish, not to universally insinuate anything inherently bad about the mark. Any negative connotations associated with dark skin in the scope of The Book of Mormon ought not be extended to our day as it was a distinguishing mark exclusively applied for the benefit of the Nephites.

While I recognize that this is a topic that can be especially sensitive for many today, I hope that our allegiance to truth and rational interpretation of scripture always takes priority over our sentimental or political interests. I hope we never ignore or intentionally obscure the clear meaning of scriptures in attempt to change or hide their true meaning. As Alma taught, "Behold, the scriptures are before you; if ye will wrest them it shall be to your own destruction." (Alma 13:20)
